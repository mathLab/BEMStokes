We have a tria of 10 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
Creating the box
There are 80 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices
Fixed euler vector with exact norm of support points
6.32456 : 6.32456

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
6.27673 6.27673
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 6.27673
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.500514
Using 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = -4.03171e-18 7.73847e-18
Fixed euler vector with exact norm of support points
6.32456 : 6.32456
