106
We have a tria of 106 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
Creating the box
There are 324 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
12.1766 12.1766
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 12.1766
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.031013
Using 0 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = -0.000144065 -0.00129566 -0.000692987
