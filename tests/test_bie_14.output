Test on the Geometry in 3D. We test the convergence of the normal vector
Testing for degree = 1
Testing for degree = 1
6
We have a tria of 6 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
There are 24 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
8 8
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 8
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.36338
Using 0 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = 8.23994e-18 1.1601e-17 3.57787e-18
   Iterations needed to solve mass matrix:         1
