We have a tria of 10 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
There are 20 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices
Analyzing frame = 0 over 120
3.16228 : 3.16228
Analyzing frame = 1 over 120
3.16228 : 3.16228

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
6.18034 6.18034
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 6.18034
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.508184
Using 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = 3.63135e-18 3.92958e-18
   Iterations needed to solve mass matrix:         1
