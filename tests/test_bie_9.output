We have a tria of 10 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
Creating the box
There are 20 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices
Analyzing frame = 0 over 120
3.16228 : 3.16228
Analyzing frame = 1 over 120
3.16228 : 3.16228

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
6.18034 6.18034
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 6.18034
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.508184
Using 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = 3.63135e-18 3.92958e-18
   Iterations needed to solve mass matrix:         1
Test on the assembling of the Single Layer and the tangential projector
Check on the tangential projection (should be zero): 0
Check on the V operator Norm (should be zero): 0.000256497
Check on the V operator Norm (should be zero) pure: 0.000256497
Corrected V
Check on the V operator Norm post (should be one) pure: 1
building versor matrix
correcting K matrix
check with versor vector : 0 l_infty : 1
check with versor vector : 1 l_infty : 1
monolithic building
OK Index Sets for the tests
OK test on tangential projector
OK test on Single Layer kernel post correction
