Minimum Test for the preconditioner with interior problem and the monolithic system
We consider the wall to have normal parallel to the i axis
106
We have a tria of 106 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
There are 324 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
12.1766 12.1766
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 12.1766
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.031013
Using 0 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = -0.000144065 -0.00129566 -0.000692987
   Iterations needed to solve mass matrix:         1
Check on the tangential projection (should be zero): 0
Check on the V operator Norm (should be zero): 0.00243632
Check on the V operator Norm (should be zero) pure: 0.00243632
Corrected V
Check on the V operator Norm post (should be one) pure: 1
building versor matrix
correcting K matrix
check with versor vector : 0 l_infty : 1
check with versor vector : 1 l_infty : 1
check with versor vector : 2 l_infty : 1
monolithic building
