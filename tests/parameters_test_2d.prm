  # parameter, in the form `var1=value1, var2=value2, ...'.
  #
  # A typical example would be to set this runtime parameter to
  # `pi=3.1415926536' and then use `pi' in the expression of the actual
  # formula. (That said, for convenience this class actually defines both `pi'
  # and `Pi' by default, but you get the idea.)

  # expressions like `if(x>0, 1, -1)' where the expression evaluates to the

  # variables at which the function is currently evaluated. However, you can
