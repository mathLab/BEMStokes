We have a tria of 106 cells.
Computing the euler vector for the reference grid
There are 5094 degrees of freedom
re-ordering vector
re-initializing sparsity patterns and matrices
Fixed euler vector with exact norm of support points
41.2068 : 41.2068

Computing the center of mass of our system for the frame 0
12.5415 12.5415
The Mass (Surface) of the entire system is : 12.5415
The Mass (Surface) error of the entire system is : 0.00197929
Using 0 0 0 as force pole.
Center of mass position = -9.7047e-06 -7.94313e-05 -4.23995e-05
Fixed euler vector with exact norm of support points
